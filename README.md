Sample Health Data and Output of Pi 1 B+ and Pi 2 B

ping.txt was output from a test using wifi-usb dongle made by Ralink (seen in the lsusb.txt file... it works out of the box (tested on pios and windows) and supports monitor mode and packet injection. Advised to plug it in before booting your OS for thr first time. 

Recommended to run PiOS lite (headless) 32 bit (for better performance) or a legacy 32 bit PiOS desktop build (for convenience)

I have a high resolution display, via hdmi but if you set the resolution lower, you can get better performance
