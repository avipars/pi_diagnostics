Sample Health Data and Output of Pi 1 B+, Pi 2 B, Pi Zero W

For these devices: Recommended to run PiOS lite (headless) 32 bit (for better performance) or a legacy 32 bit PiOS desktop build (for convenience)

I am using a high resolution display but if you set the resolution lower, you can get better performance + use less RAM
